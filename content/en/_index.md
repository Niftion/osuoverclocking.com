# What do you do? 

We are a group of computer loving students who meet up weekly to compete in liquid nitrogen overclocking competitions. What is liquid nitrogen overclocking? Glad you asked - LN2 (liquid nitrogen) overclocking is where we push our computer parts to their full potential (that's the overclocking part). This generates a lot of heat, so to counteract the heat, we use liquid nitrogen to cool it down. We then compete to essentially get the fastest computer. It's exilerating, a great skill to learn, and we teach it all. No experience needed. We also work on other fun computer cooling projects with companies like Intel and Microsoft. We're currently creating a computer completely immersed in mineral oil.

# When / Where
