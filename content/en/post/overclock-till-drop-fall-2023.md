The Overclock Till you Drop event will be happening on 8 Dec 2023 for Winter term.

This event, for those who have never been, is an all night event full of 
overclocking!
We try to set records, have fun, and have a good night before finals hits.

Food, drink, candy, and computers are provided. We look forward to all those who can
make it.
